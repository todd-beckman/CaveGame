Follow these directions if you have not configured your project folder since the 34th commit.

To use, make an empty project in Eclipse and then run $git clone in the project directory. This should produce .gitignore, overview.txt, src folder, and test folder.

    - esof322/a2: Requires BreezySwing.jar

##To run the tests:

In Eclipse, right click on the src folder and, in the Build Path option, select "Remove from Build Path".

Then, right click the test folder and, in the Build Path option, select "Use as Source Folder".

    - All test packages require junit-4.12 and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

##Installing required libraries:

Add required libraries to the project using Project->Properties->Build Path->Libraries->Add External JAR.
