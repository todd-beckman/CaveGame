addroom:Outside. The shed straight ahead is locked, but a ladder leads into the hideout underground.
addroom:There is a gate to the north and an opening to the east. Maybe the person here can help us?
addroom:A ladder leads back up. Halls lead north, east, and west
addroom:A gate straight ahead might be open, but the west is open. I wonder if this person might have advice.
addroom:Gates to the east and south. A switch in the center of the room. Only one thing left to do.
addroom:Gates to the north, east, and west, but the southern exit is free.
addroom:A switch might help with the gates to the south and west.
addroom:Another person, this far in? Head down to the basement first! Then leave through the southern entrance.
addroom:There is the key! Wait a minute...
addroom:The whole time, it was at the front entrance. I could have picked the lock myself.
